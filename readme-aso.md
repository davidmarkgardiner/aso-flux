# Azure Service Operator with GitOps Implementation Checklist

## Initial Setup

- [ ] Create small management Kubernetes cluster for each environment
- [ ] Set up GitOps repository with multi-environment structure
- [ ] Generate service principals or workload identities for each environment
- [ ] Configure RBAC roles and permissions in Azure

## ASO Installation with Secret Verification

- [ ] Install cert-manager on each cluster
- [ ] Create namespace for ASO (azureserviceoperator-system)
- [ ] Create and verify ASO credential secrets
  - [ ] Verify secret exists before proceeding with installation
  - [ ] Consider using Sealed Secrets or SOPS for GitOps
- [ ] Install ASO via Helm with appropriate CRD patterns
- [ ] Verify ASO controller is running correctly

## Flux GitOps Implementation

- [ ] Install Flux CLI tools
- [ ] Bootstrap Flux on each environment cluster
- [ ] Configure Flux to watch the GitOps repository
- [ ] Set up kustomizations for environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Configure variable substitution for environment-specific values
- [ ] Test GitOps workflow with a simple resource

## Azure Resources as ASO CRDs (Replacing ARM)

- [ ] Define base Azure resources as ASO custom resources
- [ ] Create environment overlays with variable substitution
- [ ] Test resource creation via GitOps
- [ ] Compare and validate against previous ARM deployments
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting for ASO operations

## Environment Variables Management

- [ ] Create ConfigMaps for environment-specific variables
- [ ] Configure Flux for variable substitution
- [ ] Test variable substitution across environments
- [ ] Document variable naming conventions and usage

## Security and Access Control

- [ ] Implement least-privilege RBAC for ASO service principals
- [ ] Configure network policies for ASO controller
- [ ] Set up audit logging for Azure resource changes
- [ ] Implement GitOps access controls (branch protection, approvals)

## Troubleshooting and Rollback

- [ ] Document rollback procedures
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create runbooks for common issues
- [ ] Test disaster recovery scenarios

## Documentation and Training

- [ ] Create architecture diagrams
- [ ] Document deployment procedures
- [ ] Create user guides for adding new resources
- [ ] Train team members on GitOps workflow

## Final Validation

- [ ] Test complete workflow across all environments
- [ ] Verify all variables are properly substituted
- [ ] Ensure credentials are securely managed
- [ ] Confirm GitOps reconciliation is working properly
